# CeilingFanCSharp5 C# 5.0 Console App

## Description

The simplest way to run this is to directly run the .exe file, located in the bin folder (CeilingFanCSharp5/CeilingFanCSharp5/CeilingFanCSharp5/bin/Debug/net5.0/CeilingFanCSharp5.exe). This should open a console window, which you can run the app through.

Alternately, you can run the code by launching the solution file in Visual Studio. Once loaded in Visual Studio, hit the run button, which will run the app in a console window.

All logic is written in C# 5.0. This is a fairly simplistic app, which will allow you to change the speed and direction of a ceiling fan.
